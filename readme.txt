Prosociate makes it easy to earn commissions with Amazon's associate program by posting products into WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**Prosociate is the best way to build Amazon affiliate stores with WordPress.**

Prosociate is the most complete and powerful plugin for Amazon affiliate marketers. Get paid. Prosociate integrates with Amazon's affiliate program, so you earn a commission whenever you refer a sale to Amazon.

**Easy to use.** Prosociate is extremely easy to use, even if you are new to affiliate marketing. Prosociate is a WordPress plugin, which means all aspects of your site can be controlled from the easy-to-use WordPress admin panel.

**WooCommerce.** Prosociate leverages the power of WooCommerce to be the easiest, simplest, and most powerful solution for building Amazon affiliate stores with WordPress.

**Fast and efficient.** In less than an hour you can have a ready-to-promote affiliate store, populated with thousands of products.

With our 3.0 upgrade we are offering the latest generation of technology available for Amazon Associates:

**Use any WordPress Theme.** Because WooCommerce works with any theme, Prosociate works with any theme. No customizations are required. You never have to touch a line of code, even to customize your site. How awesome is that?

**90-Day Cookie.** Usually there is a 24 hour window to receive credit for a sale after following a standard Amazon affiliate link. But since Prosociate adds the product(s) to the cart, Amazon extends the window to 90 days – ensuring your earning potential is maximized.

**WooCommerce.** WooCommerce is the industry-standard eCommerce plugin for WordPress. It’s free and you can install it in one click from within Prosociate. WooCommerce is packed with great features that a standalone Amazon plugin would never have a hope of matching.

**SEO Plugin Integration.** WordPress and WooCommerce already have great SEO features. Prosociate is compatible with any SEO plugin for WordPress, including WordPress SEO by Yoast, and All In One SEO Pack.

**Granular Searching** - You can directly search Amazon by price range, manufacturer, keyword, discount level and more.
